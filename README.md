An app that compares mobile specifications, cpu, SoC and laptops using web scraping. This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison tool for phones, SoCs (System on Chips), laptops and laptop CPUs.And I used web scraping technology to extract data from website (only for educational purpose). Built with jetpack compose, multi-modules, dependency injection (Dagger Hilt), Clean Architecture, MVVM pattern, and web scraping(Jsoup), this app offers a seamless and intuitive experience for users to compare various devices and their specifications.
